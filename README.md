# randomwalk
Simulating random walks in 2D/3D using matplotlib

using geometric and arithmetic series, we simulated random walks starting in 2 dimensions, then 3. We used matplotlib in order to display our results. you don't need anything to run this code on python besides the imports that are already in the code.
